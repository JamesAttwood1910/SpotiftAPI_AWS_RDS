# SpotifyAPI_AWS_RDS
Project using the spotify api to get song data, with this then being stored in a AWS database (MYSQL RDS). 

Two articles explaining this process were written on Medium: 

Part 1 - https://medium.com/@attwood1910/spotify-api-with-python-and-aws-d9b3d0f78e8b

Part 2 - Awaiting publication. 

The python code used to query the database with SQL is provided in the repository. 

Good software development principales were employed throughout this project with:
- Lines of code commented, 
- repetition in code avoided, 
- and functions created were appropriate.
